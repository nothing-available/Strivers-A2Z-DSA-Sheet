/* There is a frog on the 1st step of an N stairs long staircase. The frog wants to reach the Nth stair. HEIGHT[i] is
the height of the (i+1)th stair. If Frog jumps from the ith to the jth stair, the energy lost in the jump is given 
by |HEIGHT[i-1] - HEIGHT[j-1] |. If the Frog is on the ith staircase, he can jump either to (i+1)th stair or to (i+2)th
stair. Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog to reach from the 1st stair to the Nth stair.
